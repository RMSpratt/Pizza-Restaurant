            <section class="questions">
                <p class="question">Q: Can the arcade be fully booked for a birthday party or event?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    A: For the enjoyment of all of our guests, private bookings are not regularly supported. However, by booking ahead,
                    our staff can better manage the amount of customers present at the time of a party to help keep crowding minimal.
                </p>
                <p class="question">Q: Is the arcade for adults too?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    A: Of course! Space voyagers of any age are welcome in the Astronomical Arcade. We have tons of retro space-themed games 
                    such as Space Attackers and Asteroidz!
                </p>
                <p class="question">Q: Is this even a real restaurant?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    A: Sadly this website only advertises a fake restaurant for a post-secondary assignment. If I ever decide to drop 
                    everything and realize my dream of becoming a space-themed restaurant owner and operator, I'll be sure let you know.
                </p>
                <p class="question">Q: Hey this reminds me of that fictional pizza place, Pizza Planet!</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    A: Sorry, not sure what you're referring to. Any resemblence between this fine fictional piza establishment and whichever 
                    one you were referring to is purely coincidental! (Asides from perhaps taking just a bit of inspiration...)
