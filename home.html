                <p>Here at Planet Pizza we take the health and safety of our guests and staff very seriously. In response to the on-going pandemic, we are
                    making sure to keep our dining room clean and have modified it to help enforce proper social distancing practices. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our kitchens, bathrooms, and arcade area, we are continuously sanitizing and will continue to offer limited access to our patrons while 
                    safety precautions are in place. All of our staff will be wearing masks while serving you, and we ask that our guests do so while traversing 
                    the restaurant.
